# Telnet-Client-Server

This is part of our College mini-project in Computer Networks subject.

We are a group of 4 members who have implemented a TELNET Server to test the TELNET Client.

# About the Project.

As we know that Telnet is a client/server protocol that uses TCP to establish a
session between a user terminal and a remote host. Here the Telnet client
software takes input from the user and sends it to the server, which feeds it to
the host machine's operating system.
Ultimately we will establish a connection between the TELNET Client and the
TELNET server which uses TCP (Transmission Control Panel).
